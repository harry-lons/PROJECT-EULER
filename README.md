## Harry's Project Euler Solutions (1-100)

This repository contains my solutions to the first 100 [project euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

Public sharing of solutions to problems past the first 100 is prohibited, but I may have solved later problems as well.

My favorite problem that I have solved so far was number 96, "Su Doku", which I used a depth-first-search algorithm for. It was also the most challenging for me.

I also enjoyed [problem 836](https://projecteuler.net/problem=836) ;)
